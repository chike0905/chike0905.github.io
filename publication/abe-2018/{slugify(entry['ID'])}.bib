 abstract = {A type of Bitcoin node called" Full Node" has to hold the entire of historical transaction data called" Blockchain" to verify that new transactions are correct or not. To operate nodes as Full Nodes, the required storage size will be too large for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, to mitigate storage size, we propose a storage load balancing scheme by distributed storage based on Distributed Hash Table (DHT). By our scheme, nodes in a DHT cluster can behave like Full Nodes without holding the entire of the blockchain.},
